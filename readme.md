#SAM-FP

 This page contains some scripts that help me (and hopefully will
 help you too) to reduce Fabry-Perot data obtained at 
 [SOAR Telescope](http://www.ctio.noao.edu/soar/) with 
 [SOAR Adaptive Module](http://www.ctio.noao.edu/soar/content/soar-adaptive-optics-module-sam),
 or SAM. 

 This observing mode is considered a Restricted User Instrument and you 
 will have support to reduce, edit, visualize and manipulate your data.

 Scripts for data-reduction are saved inside the `scripts` folder. Each script is described individually
 in our Wiki page.
