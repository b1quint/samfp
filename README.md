# SAM-FP Tools

This page contains some scripts that help me (and hopefully will help you too)
to reduce data obtained with SAM-FP, a new observation mode at the
[SOAR Telescope](http://www.ctio.noao.edu/soar/). This mode, consists of a
Fabry-Perot interferometer installed within the [SOAR Adaptive Module](http://www.ctio.noao.edu/soar/content/soar-adaptive-optics-module-sam)
(SAM) and runs in scanning mode.

SAM-FP is considered a Restricted User Instrument and you will have support to
reduce, edit, visualize and manipulate your data.

Scripts for data-reduction are saved inside the `scripts` folder. Each script is
described individually in our Wiki page. If you install `SAM-FP Tools` in
your system you will be able to run them from anywhere.
