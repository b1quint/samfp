    0.0.0 - Starting from old version. Some features may not be working. My
            idea is to implement each of the scripts as a bin to be installed
            using setup.py and the entry_points keyword.
    0.1.0 - xjoin was released again. It is working and installed using
            entry_points.
    0.2.0 - mkcube can now be called as script again and it is installed using
            pip.
    0.3.0 - phmxtractor can now be called as script again and it is installed
            using pip.
